# Web-Based Inventory Management System (MVC)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Web-Based Inventory Management System is designed to help organizations manage products and stock levels efficiently.  
Manual inventory systems and spreadsheet-based solutions are error-prone, insecure, and difficult to maintain.  
This project provides a web-based solution using **Java MVC architecture** to automate inventory operations and ensure accuracy, security, and real-time updates.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Manual and spreadsheet-based inventory systems lack:
- Accuracy
- Security
- Real-time stock updates  

These limitations often lead to stock mismanagement and operational inefficiencies.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The proposed system automates inventory management operations such as:
- Product management
- Category management
- Stock tracking  

The system is built using **MVC architecture**, ensuring proper separation between:
- Business logic
- User interface
- Data handling  

This improves scalability, maintainability, and performance.
